## Problem Statement

Modern CI/CD systems increasingly rely on AI-assisted automation to generate deployment steps, configuration changes, and release decisions. When hallucination occurs, these systems may produce incorrect commands, invalid configurations, and sometimes non-existent version updates without verification. This can lead to failed builds, broken pipelines, security vulnerabilities, and unintended changes in production environments. Therefore, ensuring grounded validation and reliable decision-making is critical to prevent propagation of incorrect actions across automated deployment workflows.

---

## Motivation

CI/CD pipelines enable rapid and reliable software delivery but also introduce significant risk as automation scales. In weakly configured environments, even a single unverified action can cascade into failures, security issues, and production instability. This project focuses on building a hallucination-resistant, evidence-driven release intelligence system to ensure safer and more reliable AI-assisted CI/CD workflows.

---

## Proposed Approach

To reduce hallucination in CI/CD workflows, this system uses two techniques:  
(1) advanced prompting  
(2) abstention with “I don’t know”

### 🔹 Advanced Prompting

#### External Knowledge Restriction
Limits the LLM to use only retrieved, trusted data instead of its internal knowledge, ensuring responses are grounded and verifiable.

#### Iterative Refinement
Reuses the model’s initial output for follow-up prompts to verify, correct, and improve the response.

#### Directional Stimulus Prompting
Guides the model with structured hints to focus on relevant aspects like vendor, version, patch for more precise outputs.

### 🛑 Abstention

Returns:
> “I don’t know based on available verified data”

- Avoids incorrect or unsafe outputs  
- Ensures only evidence-backed responses

**Figure 1: User Interface for Prompt Guidance and System Monitoring.**  
The interface guides users in forming structured prompts and provides a dashboard displaying the number of queries responded to, abstained responses, and supported system vendors.

**Figure 2: Patch Query Response Based on Intent Detection.**  
The system detects patch-related intent in the query and returns a grounded response, including relevant patch links retrieved from verified sources.

**Figure 3: Abstention Mechanism for Insufficient Evidence.**  
When evidence is insufficient (e.g., unlisted vendors or no patch available for the specified date), the system abstains and returns an “I don’t know” response instead of generating incorrect information.

**Figure 4:** This figure shows how hallucination rates decrease as mitigation techniques are applied. The baseline has the highest rate, while external knowledge restriction, iterative refinement, and directional prompting progressively improve accuracy. The combined approach achieves the lowest hallucination rate, demonstrating the effectiveness of layered, evidence-based controls.

## Future Directions

- Add additional system vendors, expanding those listed in the side navigation bar  
- Extend intent support beyond current version and patch queries to include changelog, CVE, and additional query types  
- Enable prompts that summarize vendor-specific patch, cve counts  
- Support exporting summarized results into `.xlsx` format for reporting and analysis
